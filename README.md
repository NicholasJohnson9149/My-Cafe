The code used in the My Cafe tutorial on making a spark powered coffee maker.

Here at Spark we have updated a coffee maker to help keep the office going all day long with amazing coffe. By adding a Spark core to this old My Cafe coffee maker with built in grinder we can leave fresh beans and water in the night before and trun it on on the way to the office so when we arive theres freah hot coffee to kick start everything!
